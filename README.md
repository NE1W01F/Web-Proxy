# Web-Proxy

I am trying to work on a web proxy that can block url and domains as well
as moniter internet trafic

# Note: This Project Needs To Be Done In C#

# What Needs Doing

- Make the socks5 proxy
- Making a way to block Domains, URL and Ip using a TXT file. (like a firewall)
- Making a way of monitoring Internet trafic and loging it in a TXT file (this is so that we can inprove the ad blocking)
- It needs to support HTTP and HTTPS (this is so we can view the trafic and load the page)
- Needs to have a Login for the socks5 proxy (this is for securty)
- Needs to support Firefox, Chrome and Safari. (need to work with android and apple)
